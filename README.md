# Phase to Rate Coding
This is the code underlying an ongoing research project where we investigate how spatial phase information in grid cells is processed in a biophysically
realistic model of the dentate gyrus. The main purpose of this repository is to show the code we used and allow reproduction of the main findings.

# Usage
<ol>
<li><p>Open a terminal and clone the repository</p><blockquote>git clone https://github.com/barisckuru/phase-to-rate.git</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Inside the cloned repository create an environment with conda</p><blockquote>cd phase-to-rate<br />conda env create -f environment.yml</blockquote>
<ol>
  
If you encounter problems with creating the conda environment that relate to pydentate you can look for a solution in the [pydenate repo](https://github.com/danielmk/pydentate). There are some known issues that relate to installing NEURON on windows. Once the conda environment is created, activate it with `conda activate phasetorate` and you should be able to run the scripts

# Reproducing findings
Coming soon.
